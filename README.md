# Overview:

**BookSync** is a reading log application that helps users stay on top of their reading goals by allowing them to search for books, track what they’ve read, and organize everything in one place. Users can create a personal reading list, manage their entries, and export them directly to their Notion workspace for long-term tracking and reflection. The app is designed to streamline the book logging process while providing a seamless, user-friendly experience.
